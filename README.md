## 📖 About

`abops` is a React web application which features a collection of in-depth information regarding common dog and cat eye diseases. The project is based on [Atlas Bolesti Oka Pasa i Mačaka](https://oculus-vet.com/atlas-bolesti-oka-pasa-i-macaka/) by Siniša Groznanić PhD, Slavica Đukić DVM spec., Sergei Luzetskiy, Natalija Miličić-Matić DVM, PhD and Tatjana Lazić DVM, PhD. 

The application is divided into sections of various types of eye diseases with explanations, images, and captions. It also features an "About Us", "Contact" and "Gallery" page.

It has been created for demonstration purposes only and exclusively in the native language of the source material on the Faculty of Informatics and Digital Technologies, University of Rijeka.
